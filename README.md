# Egg-catcher
This Python code creates a simple egg-catching game using the Tkinter library. Players control a catcher to catch falling eggs while avoiding losing lives. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its key features:
Key Features:
Game Setup: The game window features a blue sky background and a green "ground" area. Eggs fall from the top of the screen, and the player must catch them using a movable catcher.

Egg Creation: Eggs are randomly generated at the top of the canvas with a variety of colors. The speed and frequency of the eggs' fall increase over time, adding to the challenge.

Catching Mechanism: The player can move the catcher left or right using keyboard arrow keys. If the catcher successfully catches an egg, the score increases, and the speed and frequency of falling eggs become more challenging.

Lives System: The player starts with three lives. If an egg is missed and falls past the catcher, a life is lost. The game ends when all lives are lost, at which point the final score is displayed in a message box.

Dynamic Scoring: The game keeps track of the score and updates it on the screen whenever an egg is caught.

Example Controls:
Left Arrow: Move the catcher left.
Right Arrow: Move the catcher right.
This simple yet engaging game can be enhanced by adding features such as sound effects, additional obstacles, or power-ups.
